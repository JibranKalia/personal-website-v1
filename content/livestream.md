#### What we are building?

The name of the app is **ridwan.io**. It is a Learning Management System for students memorizing Holy Quran.

This a spreadshet one of our Quran teachers use to record student progress [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OxS0xbLkGXO1HOMCInlix0jywb-naC3CoFFkDPeQ5T8/edit?usp=sharing).


Really the first goal of the app is to remove the need for the spreadsheet. Currently the teacher then texts the result to the parents.
The app will:

- [ ] Allow Teacher Login
- [ ] Pull up a list of students for that teacher
- [ ] Allow teacher to select student and then enter the student lesson details via a nice intutive form
- [ ] Format the data into a nice message that teacher can then text to the parents. (This part will evolve in the future with parent clients)


#### Technology Stack

React Native + Apollo + Graphql
