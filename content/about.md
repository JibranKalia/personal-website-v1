I am full-stack software developer based in Austin, TX.

I love programming and reading. I am starting to fall in love with writing and [pickleball](https://youtu.be/WLWj2LXecHU) as well.

You can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jibran-kalia/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jibrankalia), and [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/jibrankalia). Or write me an email to jibran.kalia@gmail.com
